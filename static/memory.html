            <h3>Memory & How It Changes</h3>
            <h4>Different Types Of Memory:</h4>
                <p><strong>Short-Term Memory: </strong> is the ability to hold small amounts of information for a short period, like remembering a phone number just long enough to dial it. As we age, this type of memory tends to decline a bit, making it harder to retain new information immediately.</p>
                <p><br> <strong>Working Memory: </strong> is a more active form of short-term memory where we process and manipulate information (e.g., doing mental math). Older adults may find it harder to juggle multiple tasks or remember things in real-time.</p>
                <p><br> <strong>Long-Term Memory: </strong> memory stores information for a longer time. There are two types:</p>
            <li><strong>Episodic Memory: </strong>This involves remembering specific events or experiences from your life. It tends to be more affected by aging, making it harder for older adults to recall recent events.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Semantic Memory: </strong>This involves facts and general knowledge (e.g., knowing the capital of France). This type of memory tends to remain relatively stable with age, and may even improve because of accumulated knowledge.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Procedural Memory: </strong>This involves remembering how to do things, like riding a bike or tying your shoes. It generally remains intact with age and may even improve as a person gets older, due to years of experience and practice.</li>
            <h4><br>How Memory Declines:</h4>
            <p><strong>Slower Brain Processing: </strong>As we get older, the brain processes information more slowly. This means it might take a bit longer to learn something new or recall a specific memory.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Decline in the Hippocampus: </strong>The hippocampus is the brain area associated with forming new memories. With age, the hippocampus shrinks slightly, which can make it harder to remember new information or recent events.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Decreased Connectivity: </strong>Neurons in the brain may become less connected over time, which means information isn't processed as efficiently. This can lead to issues with recall and quick thinking.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Attention and Focus: </strong>As we age, it becomes harder to concentrate for long periods. If attention is divided or not fully focused on a task, the brain may not encode the information properly, leading to forgetfulness.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Changes in Sleep: </strong>Sleep is crucial for memory consolidation (the process where memories become stable). As we age, sleep patterns may change, leading to poorer quality sleep, which can, in turn, affect memory.</p>
            <h4><br> How Memory Improves:</h4>
            <p><strong>Knowledge and Expertise: </strong>As we accumulate knowledge over time, our ability to recall facts, solve problems based on experience, and use wisdom often improves. This is why older adults tend to perform better in some areas of intellectual tasks despite memory declines.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Emotional Memory: </strong>Interestingly, emotional memory can be more stable or even better as we age. Older adults tend to remember emotionally significant events or experiences more clearly, likely due to increased emotional regulation with age.</p>
            <h4><br> Why Memory Changes:</h4>
            <p><strong>Brain Structure Changes: </strong>As we get older, some areas of the brain shrink, while others may grow slightly. For example, the prefrontal cortex, which helps with decision-making and problem-solving, tends to shrink with age. However, the brain is also quite adaptable and can compensate for some losses.</p>
            <p><br> <strong>Neurotransmitter Changes: </strong>Neurotransmitters are chemicals that help with communication between brain cells. As we age, the levels of some neurotransmitters (like acetylcholine) decrease, affecting cognitive functions such as memory.</p>
            <p id="exercise"><br><strong>Genetics and Health: </strong>Genetics, overall health, lifestyle, and environmental factors (such as diet, exercise, and social engagement) play a significant role in memory changes. For example, people who engage in physical and mental activities tend to experience less memory decline.</p>
